# AirBnB Clone - The Console
is a complete web application, integrating database storage, a back-end API, and front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB. Currently we only implements the back-end console.

# The Console
* Create your data model
* Manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
* Store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
